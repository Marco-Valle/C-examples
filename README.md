# C-examples
Some C exercises

There are some exercise of C coding.
Feel free to read and download them if you want.
The last examples are more clear and clever, beacuse I'm improving my coding skills.
It is possible that in some of the first examples there are some mistakes (memory leaks, pointers returned from functions), as I mentioned before these are exercitations that I do in order to improve, so please relax and enjoy your life.

# Notes

Example 01:
* The output is different from the asignment one. I didn't care about this task.
