A file has the following format:
- the first row contains an integer number n
- the following n rows store a string (each string is terminated
  by a '\n' character).
The longest string included in the file is 100 character long but
the average string length is much smaller (e.g., 10 characters).

A C program receives two file names on the command line (input and
output file names).
The first file has the format previously specified.
The program:
1) reads the content of the first (input) file and stores all strings
   into a dynamic data structure
2) orders the strings in alphabetic order
3) stores the strings in the second (output) file.
   The output file has the same format of the input one.
