A matrix of strings is stored in a file with the following format:

R C
string_1_1 string_1_2 string_1_3 ... string_1_C 
...
string_R_1 string_R_2 string_R_3 ... string_R_C 

where R and C are integers, representing the number of rows and
columns of the matrix, and string_i_j are the strings stored in
the matrix.
Each string is at most 20 characters long.
Notice that strings on each row are already alphabetically ordered.

Write a C program able to "merge" all strings in the matrix in a
single array of strings, i.e., to store all strings of the matrix
in a unique array containing all strings alphabetically ordered.

The result has to be stored in an output file, which contains
the total number of strings on the first row, and all string in the
following lines.
