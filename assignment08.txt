A "producer" file includes a line for each car manufacturer with the
following format:
manufactuiredName id
where manufacturerName and id are strings of 20 characters at most.
The following is an example:

FIAT it001
ALFA_ROMEO it002
BMW ge001
MERCEDES ge002
TOYOTA ja001
...

The size of the file, and the order of the lines within the file, are
unknown.

A "product" file stores the product names and relative prices for each
product of each manufacturer, with the format:
id productName price
The following one is an example:

it001 500 15131
it001 Panda 12001
it001 Punto 17891
ge002 AClass 22411
ge002 CClass 75641
...

The size (and order) of the file is unknown.

Write a C program that:
* receives two file names on the command line
* stores the content of the two files (the first one of type "producer",
  the second one of type "product") in a proper data structure
* goes through an iteration in which it reads the name of a
  manufacturer (e.g, FIAT) and it prints-out all products (and
  relative prices) produced by it on standard output.

Suggestion
----------

Implement a "list of lists", i.e., a main "producer" list with
a secondary "product" list for each producer element.

 ------	   ------    ------	 	 
 |    | -> |    | -> |    | -> ... product list
 ------    ------    ------   
   |
   v
 ------    ------	 
 |    | -> |    | -> ...
 ------	   ------   
   |
   v
producer
 list
 ...

as with this data structure it is easy to find all products
manufactured by a given producer.
