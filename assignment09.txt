Exercise 01
-----------

Write a C program solving the "magic square" problem.

A "magic square" of size equal to n is a (n x n) matrix of
integers containing only integer numbers from 1 to (n x n),
such that the sum of those values on all rows, on all columns,
and on the two diagonals is the same.

The program has to receive two parameters on the command line:
* an integer value n
* a file name
and it has to store one magic square of size n on the file.

Example
-------

If we suppose to run the program with the following two parameters
3 square.txt
it has to store in the file the following matrix:

8 3 4
1 5 9
6 7 2

which includes all numbers from 1 to 9 (3x3) and satisfies the requested
criteria (all the above mentioned sums are equal to 15).
